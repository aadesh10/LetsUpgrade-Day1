/* difference between var,let and const
1.Var
The scope of a variable defined with the keyword var is limited to the function within which it is defined.
If it is defined outside any function,the scope of the variable is global.

2.Let
The scope of a variable defined with the keyword let or const 
is limited to the block defined by curly braces i.e.{}

3.Const
The scope of a variable defined with the keyword const is limited to the block defined by curly braces.
however if a variable is defined with keyword const,it cannot be reassigned
