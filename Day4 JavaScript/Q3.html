<!-- Imagine you are going out to do some grocery shopping. So you have an 
array called shoppingList with all the products you want to buy -->
<!--Now that  you are inside of the shop , you have a basket with all the 
products from your list but you want to add a few more. -->
<!-- Create a new array called shoppingBasket, that will be a copy of the 
shoppingList array, and add some new products into it -->
